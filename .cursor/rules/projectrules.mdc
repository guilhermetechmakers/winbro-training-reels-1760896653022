# Project Cursor Rules

This file contains project-specific development rules and guidelines.
These rules will be automatically applied when working in this project with Cursor.

## Design Pattern: ---

## Visual Style

### Color Palette:
- Background: #F9FAFB (very light gray, main background)
- Primary Text: #111827 (almost black, used for headings)
- Secondary Text: #6B7280 (medium gray, for subtext and descriptions)
- Sidebar & Card Background: #FFFFFF (pure white, for cards and sidebar)
- Accent Blue: #2563EB (used for active tab underline and interactive states)
- Status Green: #34D399 (used for "Published" status labels)
- Status Gray: #D1D5DB (used for "Archived" status labels, dividers)
- Icon Gray: #9CA3AF (used for icons and secondary UI elements)

### Typography & Layout:
- Font Family: Sans-serif (likely Inter, with clean, geometric shapes)
- Font Weights: Bold (headings), Medium (navigation and labels), Regular (body text)
- Hierarchy: Large, bold page titles; medium-weight navigation; smaller, lighter detail text
- Spacing: Generous padding and margin between elements (24–32px gutters), airy, uncluttered
- Alignment: Left-aligned text and components; consistent vertical spacing between sections
- Typography Treatments: Clear distinction between headings (larger, bold) and descriptions (smaller, lighter)

### Key Design Elements
#### Card Design:
- Style: Flat, white cards with very subtle rounded corners (8px)
- Shadows: Extremely soft, almost imperceptible drop shadow for depth
- Borders: No visible borders; separation via shadow and spacing
- Hover States: Slight elevation or shadow increase on hover
- Visual Hierarchy: Title bold and prominent, status chips above, description below

#### Navigation:
- Pattern: Vertical sidebar with icons and text labels, profile section at top
- Sidebar: White, separated by subtle shadow from main content
- Active State: Active menu highlighted with a pill-shaped background (#F3F4F6), bold text
- Collapsible: No evidence of collapsibility; always visible navigation

#### Data Visualization:
- Chart Styles: Not present in the image; layout suggests placeholders for data visualization with soft gray backgrounds (#F3F4F6)
- Visual Treatments: Placeholder icons or thumbnail previews use soft muted grays

#### Interactive Elements:
- Buttons: Not explicitly shown; expect rounded, filled or outlined styles in accent blue (#2563EB)
- Tabs: Underlined active tab in accent blue, inactive tabs in gray
- Chips/Status Labels: Rounded pill shapes, filled with status color (green for published, gray for archived)
- Form Elements: Not shown, but likely minimalist with outlined/ghost styles and clear focus states
- Hover Effects: Subtle shadow or background change, cursor pointer on interactive elements
- Micro-interactions: Clean, unobtrusive, focused on clarity

### Design Philosophy
This interface embodies:
- A modern, ultra-minimalist B2B SaaS aesthetic focused on clarity and usability
- Design principles of simplicity, whitespace, and functional hierarchy—no visual clutter or unnecessary decoration
- A serious yet approachable tone, prioritizing professional trust and effortless navigation
- Visual strategy aims for rapid scannability, ease of onboarding, and low cognitive load, ideal for technical and industrial user personas

---" design pattern.
Ensure all implementations align with this pattern's best practices.

## Tech Stack Requirements

- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite with SWC plugin
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v3 with CSS custom properties
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Animations:** Motion library (NOT framer-motion)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **State Management:** TanStack React Query
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation

- **Notifications:** Sonner

## Critical Setup Rules

1. **ALWAYS run `npm install` before any build commands**
2. Use Motion library for animations, NOT framer-motion
3. Import Inter font in index.css
4. Use Tailwind v3 with tailwind.config.js (not CSS-based config)
5. Use `@/` path aliases for imports
6. Use Shadcn components instead of custom UI components

## Code Style

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative patterns (avoid classes)
- Favor iteration and modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Structure: exported components, subcomponents, helpers, types
- Minimize `useEffect` and `useState`; favor React Server Components where possible

## API Layer Pattern

- Centralize API calls in `src/api/` directory
- Use Axios with interceptors for auth and error handling
- Create React Query hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Implement proper error handling with toast notifications
- Use TypeScript types for all API responses

## Design System

### SaaS App-Specific Guidelines

- Implement clear authentication flows
- Create intuitive onboarding experience
- Design settings pages with clear sections
- Use progressive disclosure for complex features
- Add helpful tooltips and documentation links
- Implement billing/subscription management UI

## Design Reference (Complete Guidelines)

**This section contains the complete design guidelines for this project:**

# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text
- Confetti or celebration animations for actions

### Interactive Elements
**Engage users:**
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Sliders and range controls
- Toggle switches with animations
- Progress steps with animations
- Expandable/collapsible sections
- Tabs with slide indicators
- Image comparison sliders
- Interactive demos or playgrounds

---

## Consistency Rules

### Maintain Consistency
**What should stay consistent:**
- Spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions
- Hero section design
- Card styling variations
- Background patterns or textures
